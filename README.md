# NM-bionic-hand
Here is where I'm putting all the current files for the Nilheim Mechatronics Biomimetic Mechatronic Hand project. The development process of this project will be documented on the Will Cogley YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkUD_8b1JoTL2ipOVtxfNKw/featuredhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkUD_8b1JoTL2ipOVtxfNKw/featured. 

## FDM Prototypes
The FDM files are early prototypes designed for printing on FDM machines. It is expected that the majority of parts will be manufactured using SLA printing, so these files are only really intended as reference.
